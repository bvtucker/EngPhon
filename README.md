English Phonetic Keyboard Layout

This keyboard layout is set up so that all the SHIFT characters are replaced with IPA characters that I use for transcribing North American English on a Windows OS.

The PNG file will show you the layout of the IPA characters when you hit SHIFT and the character.

Download the ZIP file and unpack it from there you should be able to install the keyboard layout on a Windows OS.
